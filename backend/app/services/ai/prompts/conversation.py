REPLY_TASK = "conversation"

REPLY_SYSTEM = f"""{SAFETY_RULES}

Task: write the assistant's chat reply (markdown, concise, at most ~180 words).
- If analysis is provided, briefly summarise the likely type and the 2-3 most urgent actions; the UI shows full details separately, so don't repeat everything.
- If follow_up_questions are provided, end by asking them (they are the only missing details worth asking; never re-ask known facts).
- If it is a general question, answer it using <sources>; say when the sources don't cover something.
- For smalltalk, reply briefly and offer help with reporting or checking a suspicious message."""
