## Provenance — read this

The seed documents are **curated summaries written by the project team** of
publicly available guidance; they are *not* verbatim copies of the official
documents and are labelled `document_type: curated_summary`. Each links to the
official organisation page it is based on. Before relying on any detail
(helpline numbers, timelines, procedures) verify it at the linked source, and
prefer adding the original official documents here and re-running ingestion.

## Current contents

| `official/` | **Official documents**, downloaded unmodified by `python -m scripts.fetch_official_kb` from the URLs in `official_sources.json` (`document_type: official_text`; source note records URL, download date and SHA-256). | no — re-downloaded on each machine; the official texts are not redistributed in this repository |
